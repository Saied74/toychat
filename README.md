I have been reading Alex Edwards book "Let's Go" and building this application.
I have used it in the past to build other applications, but here, I am working
to build something bigger and also learn more of the ideas in the book.
I have also had my eye on doing something with the NATS server.  So, I am
combining some of the things that I have been looking to learn into this project.
